config ZMK_LED_CONTROL
    bool "Enable automatic LED control based on activity"
    default y
    help
      Keep indicator LEDs on while the board is running.
      Supports steady-on LEDs and pulsing LEDs.
      Requires indicator-led aliases in shield Devicetree.

config ZMK_DUMB_LED_TIMEOUT
    int "LED timeout in milliseconds after inactivity"
    depends on ZMK_LED_CONTROL
    default 120000
    help
      Time in milliseconds before the LED turns off due to inactivity.
      Default is 120000ms (2 minutes).
      The LED will turn back on when any key is pressed.

config ZMK_DUMB_LED_STEADY
    bool "Enable steady indicator LED (stays on)"
    depends on ZMK_LED_CONTROL
    default y
    help
      When enabled, the steady indicator LED (alias indicator-led-steady) will stay on
      while active and turn off after the inactivity timeout.

config ZMK_DUMB_LED_PULSE
    bool "Enable pulsing indicator LED"
    depends on ZMK_LED_CONTROL
    default n
    help
      When enabled, the pulsing indicator LED (alias indicator-led-pulse) will pulse
      on and off instead of staying on. The LED will pulse when active and turn off
      completely after inactivity timeout.

config ZMK_DUMB_LED_PULSE_INTERVAL
    int "LED pulse interval in milliseconds"
    depends on ZMK_DUMB_LED_PULSE
    default 500
    help
      Time in milliseconds for each pulse cycle (on/off duration).
      Default is 500ms (500ms on, 500ms off).
      Lower values create faster pulses, higher values create slower pulses.
